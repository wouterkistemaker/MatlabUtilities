% This function parses a header-file (*.hea) and retrieves the settings it contains into a struct,
% and is specifically designed to parse header-files that are present in any of the datasets
% provided by the research platform PhysioNet.org. 
% 
% Right now, only header-files that belong to ECG-research is supported, but expansion of
% this support may occor in the future.
%   
%   Apnea database header file structure :
%       - Record information:  [record name] [number of signals] [sample frequency] [total sample count]
%       - Signal specifications: [filename] [format] [ADC_Gain] [ADC_Resolution] [ADC_Zero] [initial value] [checksum] [blocksize] [description]
%
%   It is worth mentioning that some of these settings have sub-settings
%   that are not yet being parsed. These settings are:
%
%       Record information (record name):[number of segments]
%       Record information (sample frequency):[counter frequency]
%       Record information (counter frequency):[base counter value]
%
%       Signal specifications (ADC gain): [baseline]
%       Signal specifications (ADC gain): [units]
%       
%   Besides the sub-settings, there are a number of other settings that are
%   not yet included. This function was designed to parse headers from the
%   Apnea ECG Database. Therefore, one must keep in mind that this function
%   might return incomplete settings when being used on headers 
%   from other ECG databases.
%
%   Settings that are not yet included are:
%
%       Record information: [base time]
%       Record information: [base date]
%
%       Signal specifications: [samples per frame]
%       Signal specifications: [skew]
%       Signal specifications: [byte offset]
